Classes for File stream operations :-


These classes, designed to manage the disk files, are declared in fstream and therefore we must include this file in any program that uses files.

1. ios:-

·         ios stands for input output stream.

·         This class is the base class for other classes in this class hierarchy.

·         This class contains the necessary facilities that are used by all the other derived classes for input and output operations.

2. istream:-

·         istream stands for input stream.

·         This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.

·         This class handle input stream.

·         The extraction operator(>>) is overloaded in this class to handle input streams from files to the program execution.

·         This class declares input functions such as get(), getline() and read().

·          

3. ostream:-

·         ostream stands for output stream.

·         This class is derived from the class ‘ios’.

·         This class handle output stream.

·         The insertion operator(<<) is overloaded in this class to handle output streams to files from the program execution.

·         This class declares output functions such as put() and write().
