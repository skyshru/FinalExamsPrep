* Containers can be described as the objects that hold the data of the same type. Containers are used to implement different data structures for example arrays, list, 
  trees, etc.
  
* List is the sequence containers that allow the insertions and deletions from anywhere.

* Deque is the double ended queue that allows the insertion and deletion from both the ends.

* Set is an associate container for storing unique sets.

* Multiset is an associate container for storing non- unique sets.

* Map is an associate container for storing unique key-value pairs, i.e. each key is associated with only one value

* Multimap is an associate container for storing key- value pair, and each key can be associated with more than one value.

* Priority Queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue, and every element has some priority value associated with it. The priority of the elements in a
  priority queue determines the order in which elements are served (i.e., the order in which they are removed). If in any case the elements have same priority, they are 
  served as per their ordering in the queue.
  
* Classification of containers :

Sequence containers
Associative containers (like the ones which store the key value pairs)
Derived containers
